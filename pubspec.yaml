# To automatically upgrade your package dependencies to the latest versions
# consider running `flutter pub upgrade --major-versions`. Alternatively,
# dependencies can be manually updated by changing the version numbers below to
# the latest version available on pub.dev. To see which dependencies have newer
# versions available, run `flutter pub outdated`.

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:

  fonts:
     - family: Roboto
       fonts:
         - asset: assets/fonts/Roboto/Roboto-Thin.ttf
           weight: 400
         - asset: assets/fonts/Roboto/Roboto-Regular.ttf
           weight: 500
         - asset: assets/fonts/Roboto/Roboto-Medium.ttf
           weight: 600
         - asset: assets/fonts/Roboto/Roboto-SemiBold.ttf
           weight: 700
